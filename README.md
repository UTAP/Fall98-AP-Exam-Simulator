# Fall 98 
## New AP TAs Exam Simulator
At summer 98 we examine new TAs with a new project which was a course project of fall 95. For testing new applicants code, we used this simple script to easily visualize their outputs. 
This script writen with `graphics.py` librariy which is a simple graphical library for python.

### How to use 
Testing output should be in file `output.txt` in the same repository, and then run 
```
python3 Visualize.py
```
NOTE : testing map also should be in `map.dat` file at the same repository.
